When conducting a security audit for your solar panel installation app's infrastructure, consider the OWASP Top 10 for 2021 as a guide to identify potential security issues. Here's what you should look for to make your system secure:

Injection: Check for any potential injection vulnerabilities in your Python backend code, particularly in handling user inputs. Ensure that input validation and parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection.

Broken Authentication: Verify that authentication mechanisms are securely implemented across all components. Ensure strong password policies, secure session management, and proper access controls. Protect sensitive customer information and passwords in the MySQL database.

Sensitive Data Exposure: Examine how customer data is stored, transmitted, and processed. Ensure data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Use secure protocols and encryption methods for API communications.

XML External Entities (XXE): Review the code in your mobile apps and web frontend for potential XXE vulnerabilities. Disable external entity parsing and validate XML inputs to prevent XXE attacks.

Broken Access Control: Check if access controls are properly enforced. Limit access based on user roles and permissions. Ensure customer support employees and the sales employee only have access to the data and functions they need to perform their duties.

Security Misconfigurations: Review your Kubernetes container configurations, web server settings, and database access controls. Make sure that all configurations are set securely, including default credentials, unnecessary services, and security headers.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Audit your web frontend code (Javascript with Next.js) for XSS vulnerabilities. Implement output encoding and input validation to prevent malicious script injection. Regularly validate and sanitize user inputs.

Insecure Deserialization: Evaluate the usage of serialization and deserialization in your application. Be cautious about deserializing untrusted data and ensure that it's done securely to prevent deserialization attacks.

Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Keep track of all third-party libraries and components used in your application, including the operating system and Kubernetes containers. Regularly update and patch these components to address known vulnerabilities.

Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Set up proper logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents. This includes monitoring for unusual access patterns, failed login attempts, and potential security breaches.

In addition to the OWASP Top 10, consider the following security practices:

Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect against brute-force attacks.
Enforce strong API authentication and authorization for communication between the mobile apps, web frontend, and the Python backend.
Regularly perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and address security weaknesses.
Educate your software engineer employees on security best practices and provide secure coding guidelines.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive systems.
